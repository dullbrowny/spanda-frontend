# Spanda-Frontend

## Overview

The **Spanda-Frontend** repository contains the refactored frontend codebase for the Spanda platform. This repository is aligned with the newly modular pipeline-based backend architecture. The frontend is responsible for interacting with users, sending requests to the backend, and rendering the processed data.

## Key Changes in Refactoring

1. **Modularized Frontend**: The frontend has been separated into components that clearly map to different stages of the pipeline-based backend. Each frontend module communicates with a specific backend stage, ensuring clean API integration.

2. **Optimized React Structure**: The existing frontend has been reorganized to use modern React best practices, such as functional components and hooks.

3. **Improved API Layer**: A more robust API layer has been introduced to better handle communication with the backend pipeline components.

4. **UI Improvements**: The user interface has been updated to provide real-time feedback, status updates, and error handling, ensuring smooth interactions with the new backend architecture.

## Folder Structure

- `/src/`: Contains all frontend components.
  - `components/`: Modular React components used across the application.
  - `services/`: Manages API requests and responses to and from the backend.
  - `styles/`: CSS and styling for the frontend interface.

- `/public/`: Static files and assets for the application.

- `/config/`: Configuration files for environment variables and API settings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dullbrowny/spanda-frontend.git
   cd spanda-frontend
